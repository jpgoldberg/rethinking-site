I, Jeffrey Goldberg, am in the process of learning how to use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)
using the [~tabi template](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/).
So for a little while yet, you should expect to find content here
that is of as little
interest as<!-- more -->
[“Hello, World”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program),
but a proper introduction to the blog and perhaps a substantive post or two should be
coming soon.

Some ideas for future content are visible as issues with the “[Ideas](https://github.com/jpgoldberg/rethinking-site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3AIdea)” tag in this site's repository.
